Since Capstone-II is already quite similar to what we want, there are only a few changes to implement as visible in the excel sheet.
Namely, we will add the following changes:
1. Project plan for Capstone-II
2. Mid evaluation is more of a progress update along with an updated plan for the rest of the semester
3. Weekly Evaluations are still implemented with attendance
4. Introduction of Bi-weekly Project Plans (combined with the Weekly Evaluation)
5. Combining the thesis document and final evaluation
6. Introduction of Industry Evaluation/ Demo
7. No changes to Poster and Expo

| - Poster and Expo: 5%<br>- Prototype Mid-Evaluation: 10%<br>- Prototype Final Evaluation: 40%<br>- Thesis Report: 25%<br>- Weekly Retrospective: 20% | - **Project Plan for Capstone‑II:** 15%<br>- **Revised Mid Evaluation (Progress Update with Updated Plan):** 15%<br>- **Weekly Evaluations (Attendance) + Biweekly Project Plans:** 20%<br>- **Thesis Document + Final Evaluation:** 25%<br>- **Poster and Expo:** 5%<br>- **Industry Evaluation/Demo:** 20% |



The **Industry Evaluation/Demo** is set at a 20% to ensure real‑world feedback is a major component.

The new **Project Plan for Capstone‑II** (15%) accounts for the planning of the Capstone-II to ensure a meaningful timeline and goal.

 **Revised Mid Evaluation** (which now focuses on progress and plan updates) accounts for 15%, emphasizing intelligent planning and course correction.

**Biweekly Project Plans** and **Weekly Evaluations** (20%) ensure ongoing monitoring and accountability.

The core deliverables—**Thesis Document** and **Final Evaluation**—receive 25%, maintaining focus on the final technical and reflective outcomes.

**Poster and Expo** is kept at 5% to recognize their role in communicating the project’s final impact (the previous iteration also had it at 5%).
