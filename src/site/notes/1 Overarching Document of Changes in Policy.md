Note to MZ: All points in the section "Changes to be made" are links that have their own separate page. I've kept it as concise as possible.

### Already Approved
1. 2-4 is the group of students. 1 and 5 are exceptions to be argued.
2. Only relevant members of the focus groups attending the relevant evaluations and pitches to better use faculty's time.

### Changes to be made
Preamble: A lot of these changes are because people are not taking the handbook seriously. The new handbook will include the minimum set of things we are trying to get students to complete. It should be focused and students should have clarity.
1. [[Introduction of Formal Dressing Guidelines for Pitch and Evaluations\|Introduction of Formal Dressing Guidelines for Pitch and Evaluations]] - Add seriousness and bolster the importance of effective communication (CLO 11).
2. [[Introduction to late policy for all submissions\|Introduction to late policy for all submissions]] - PLO 11 and CLO 12 related to project management are reflected here. Also ties into professionalism and real world accountability.
3. [[Thesis submission right after final evaluation\|Thesis submission right after final evaluation]] - Students already ask for extensions to get to this point due to other course pressure. Let's keep it here and simply mark it late if an extension is needed from here.
4. [[Advisor Selection\|Advisor Selection]] - If a faculty initiates a project, they should be the advisor. Else, the capstone committee can chose the advisor.
5. [[Attendance Policy\|Attendance Policy]] - Attendance to push for weekly evaluations. Attendance so that it is enforced and to give students a push to meet their advisor for a progress report and to stay within the capstone course.
