The Project Deliverable Statement will include items from a EDI (taken before the Capstone) which includes requirement gathering, design thinking, systems engineering, verification tests, a project plan, a bill of materials, work division amongst the teammates and a weekly work breakdown for a 2 month horizon. The reason for this is that a lot of projects in EDI will turn into Capstone projects (which we want to encourage) and the Capstone projects that are not from EDI will simply not be on par with the rest. As an institute, we want the Capstone projects to be of a proper caliber. One learning point is that projects that came through EDI in the past were much better than the ones that did not. Another reason is that work division amongst teammates will address the issue of freeloaders and highlight individual contribution and grading. It will now also be called the Capstone Design, Engineering & Project Roadmap.

| Extensive documentation leads to unnecessary overhead. | The work will already be done in EDI. Also, reduces the unnecessary load by the Project Deliverable Statement by allowing them to simply restructure their EDI work and submitting that. |
| Reduced flexibility.                                   | We will make the rubric different for research projects.                                                                                                                                 |
