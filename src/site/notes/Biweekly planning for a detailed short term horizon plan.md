| Potential Arguments Against                                 | CounterArguments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Excessive Administrative Burden.                            | Plan only focused on 2 weeks at a time. Leverages the work done in the master plan while adjusting to the unforeseen changes in the project.                                                                                                                        |
| Too much planning which would distract them from execution. | Enhances the work by breaking down the master plan into actionable steps for the foreseeable future. Structure allows teams to quickly address emerging issues.                                                                                                     |
| Micromanagement of students.                                | Fosters students to self-assess and proactively solve the unexpected issues that arise in any project. Students maintain autonomy in how they set and adjust their short term goals.                                                                                |
| Too little value for too much work.                         | Work will not be that high considering that we are leveraging the master plan and adjusting according to the current situation. Builds discipline to project management and allows for management, even with unforeseen issues leading to a higher project quality. |
| Unnecessary stress on students.                             | Regular short term planning allows for clear and frequent goals the team can setup. Also allows the team to consider the issues and manage their resources better to resolve said issues.                                                                           |
