**Project Pitch + Roadmap (20%):**  
    Sets a clear strategic foundation and vision, ensuring every team begins with a well-defined plan that guides all subsequent work. The Roadmap is to be submitted before and explained in the Project Pitch. NEED TO CHANGE THE NAME FROM PITCH TO SOMETHING ELSE MORE RELEVANT.
    
**Mid Evaluation (15%):**  
    Acts as a crucial checkpoint for progress and course correction, enabling timely adjustments that keep the project on track. The students will also share a corrected plan for the Capstone-I.
    
**Final Evaluation + Thesis (25%):**  
    Captures the culmination of technical performance and reflective learning, rewarding both execution and critical analysis of the project journey. The thesis is to be submitted before and explained in the Final Evaluation. This is focused on the PROCESS.
    
**Weekly Evaluations + Biweekly Plans (20%):**  
    Enforces continuous accountability and agile planning, ensuring that day-to-day progress and adaptive strategies are consistently maintained.
    
**Industry Evaluation/Demo (20%):**  
    Provides essential real-world feedback that aligns academic work with professional standards, preparing students for industry challenges. This is focused on the RESULTS.

PREVIOUS PLAN (NOT TO BE PRESENTED)
#### **Project Pitch:** 5%
| Potential Arguments Against            | CounterArguments                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Under developing communication skills. | Students already well seasoned in communicating because of the presentations in EDI and to the Industry. |
| May impact early stage validation.     | This is already done in EDI through rigorous testing and validation.                                     |
| Risk of neglecting project plan        | This is why the weightage for Roadmap is higher (which includes the detailed project plan).              |
#### **Capstone Design, Engineering & Project Roadmap:** 15%
| Potential Arguments Against                                  | CounterArguments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Should be higher because it sets the vision for the project. | Already a lot of work went into it in EDI. The detailed rubric will ensure that the "Roadmap"/project plan itself is what is given the most importance. It serves as the baseline and will be improved upon and referred to repeatedly in later reflective assessments. |

#### **Mid Evaluation:** 10%
It is designed to be formative—encouraging teams to identify issues and adjust their approach—without disproportionately affecting the final grade.

#### **Final Evaluation:** 17.5%
Final evaluations are meant to reflect the culmination of the project’s technical work, problem-solving, and execution. A 17.5% weight is justified because it assesses the final product’s quality and the extent to which teams have met both their strategic and technical objectives over the entire capstone period.

#### **Weekly Evaluations:** 5% 
A 5% weight is appropriate because these are frequent, low-stakes checkpoints designed to keep teams on track rather than to serve as major grade determinants. The way we will enforce students to keep on track is through the attendance policy as previously discussed.

#### **Biweekly Project Plans:** 7.5%
A 7.5% weight provides enough incentive for teams to prepare thoughtful short-term plans without turning it into an excessive documentation burden. This is to ensure that students stay on track. This is not a time or intellectually intensive activity either.

#### Industry Evaluation/ Demo (20%):

| Industry evaluations may vary widely in their rigor or criteria depending on the specific partner or sector.                                                                                          | Olin College Arguement                                                                                                                                     |
| A 20% weight might cause some students to focus disproportionately on impressing industry evaluators, possibly at the expense of the academic and technical depth emphasized in the other components. | The 20% weight is to ensure that students deliver the project while having reference to the finalized set of requirements (that was agreed upon in EDI).   |
| Industry evaluators may have biases or different interpretations of the evaluation criteria, leading to subjectivity that could affect fairness.                                                      | By establishing transparent evaluation guidelines and involving multiple industry evaluators where possible, the impact of individual bias can be diluted. |
