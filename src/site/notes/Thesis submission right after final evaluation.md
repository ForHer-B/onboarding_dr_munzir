| Students might not have time to make a quality thesis submission. | It is being held after the final evaluation so that students can incorporate the feedback from the pitch into their thesis. They are also expected to work on their thesis from before and the feedback from the pitch is only to be an addition. |

Muhammad Farhan comments:
- There should be draft before the final (which isn't graded but is for feedback which will happen in the final evaluation)
- There should be logging of work throughout the Capstone so that it is easier to compile at the end (update the work in the weekly evaluations, if students want to not go through the hassle of the upar neechay compilation) Reporting during weekly or biweekly
