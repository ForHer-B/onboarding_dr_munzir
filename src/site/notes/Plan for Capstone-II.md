Since Capstone-II is already quite similar to what we want, there are only a few changes to implement as visible in the excel sheet.
Namely, we will add the following changes:
1. Project plan for Capstone-II
2. Mid evaluation is more of a progress update along with an updated plan for the rest of the semester
3. No changes to thesis document or final evaluation or Poster and Expo
4. Weekly Evaluations are still implemented with attendance
5. Introduction of Bi-weekly Project Plans
6. Introduction of Industry Evaluation/ Demo

Following is the new grade breakdown


- **Project Plan for Capstone‑II:** 10%
- **Revised Mid Evaluation (Progress Update with Updated Plan):** 10%
- **Weekly Evaluations (Attendance) + Biweekly Project Plans:** 10%
- **Thesis Document:** 20%
- **Final Evaluation:** 20%
- **Poster and Expo:** 5%
- **Industry Evaluation/Demo:** 20%


The **Industry Evaluation/Demo** is set at a 20% to ensure real‑world feedback is a major component.

The new **Project Plan for Capstone‑II** and **Revised Mid Evaluation** (which now focuses on progress and plan updates) together account for 20%, emphasizing early planning and course correction.

**Biweekly Project Plans** (5%) and **Weekly Evaluations** (5%) ensure ongoing monitoring and accountability without overburdening the students.

The core deliverables—**Thesis Document** and **Final Evaluation**—each receive 20%, maintaining focus on the final technical and reflective outcomes.

**Poster and Expo** is kept at 5% to recognize their role in communicating the project’s final impact (the previous iteration also had it at 5%).
