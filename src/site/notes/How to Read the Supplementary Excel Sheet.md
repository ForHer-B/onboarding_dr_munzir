For example, Biweekly Project Plans have an inverted triangle at the start of week 4 in September. That means the Sprint 1 plan is due at that time. Then at the beginning of week 2 in October, another project plan/Sprint (for the next 2 weeks) is due.
You can also see the mid evaluation has a project plan due in front of it. The project plan is only up till the end of Capstone-I.
