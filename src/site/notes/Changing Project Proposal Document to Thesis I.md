Rather than submitting a Project Proposal Document at the end of the Capstone-I, they will submit a Thesis-I document. The Project Proposal is already integrated in the Capstone Roadmap at the beginning of the semester. This will allow the students to focus more on technical work during their capstones. The thesis will also not be that big a load considering the documentation is mostly done by the Capstone Roadmap, and the mid and final evaluations.

| A standalone proposal would be better and more detailed, why are we merging the Document into the Capstone Roadmap? | Capstone Roadmap is expected to be comprehens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The proposal is currently due at the end of Capstone-I, why are we shifting it to the start?                        | Allows for more time in Capstone-I for technical work rather than project finalization. Integrating the proposal into the roadmap and then sharing the deviations and new plan in the Thesis I will allow for the corrections in plan to also be shown. By addressing deviations and adaptations in the Thesis I, the students do not need to create a separate proposal. |
| Inconsistent documentation and students might copy from the Roadmap                                                 | The thesis will be setup to be a mindful evaluation about the original planned objectives and the actual outcomes. The Roadmap will serve as a baseline. The Thesisâ€‘I document is structured to be detailed, capturing not only the final technical work but also a critical analysis of how the project deviated from the original plan and why.                         |
