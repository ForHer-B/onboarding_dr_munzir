This is to involve all the faculty that were not present in the EDI course. This will also aid the students in presenting their work to faculty. The faculty could also point out areas of concern in the project that the EDI staff or the students did not notice. The pitch scheduled after the Roadmap is so that students create the Roadmap with their advisor and then present it to be evaluated by the committee/rest of the relevant faculty. The grading of pitch and Roadmap will be done together.

| Faculty is unaware of EDI course content and system engineering. | The students already were presenting to the industry who did not know what system engineering is. They are well-trained to give the presentation to such an audience.                                                 |
| Project is expected to be mature enough to make a robust plan.   | The first time you are doing something, there should be an overarching master plan. Then short planned 2-week sprints to account for deviations from the original plan. Distribution of planning given in next point. |
